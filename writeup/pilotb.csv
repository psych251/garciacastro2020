He does have some issues though. He has to watch out for ceiling fans. It isn't always easy to find clothes. He has to shop in Big and Tall men's sections because the inseams of pants and lengths of shirts and shirt sleeves is usually too small in regular sizes. If he does want to shop regular sizes, he has to get a size that is too big for his weight to accomodate his height. It is also sometimes hard to fit into cars. He is someone who legit needs a larger SUV or truck.","I don't know very many short people. The shortest person I know is about 5'5"". She sometimes needs help to reach things at home and in stores.
